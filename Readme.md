# Stack C++

A small example exercise for Test-Driven-Development in C++.

To get the initial version of the program, clone the master branch of the repository and its submodules (for Google Test):

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hoelzl/StackCpp.git

Then, either import the project into CLion or change into the `Employee` directory and manually build it with CMake:

    cd StackCpp
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. 

Having configured the project, run `make` or launch Visual Studio with the generated solution file, depending on your platform.
